Supply chains are networks of organisations that supply and transform materials, and distribute final products to customers. Supply chain management represents a great challenge as well as tremendous opportunity for most firms. If designed and managed properly, supply chains are a crucial source of competitive advantage for both manufacturing and service enterprises.
